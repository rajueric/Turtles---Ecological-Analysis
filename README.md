# Turtles---Ecological-Analysis
A statistical-ecological analysis of turtle growth rates and mortality rate estimation for a statistics course.

For a fourth-year statistics capstone course, STA490Y1 (Statistical Consultation, Communication and Collaboration) we were asked to find methods to estimate the size and mortality rates for the populations of turtles in Algonquin Park. The turtles are marked by size, notch number, date of birth (with age estimate for those unknown based on size), capture site, etc. and other discernible information. From this various analyses and tables were made as well as statistics collected.
